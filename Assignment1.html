            <p>I want to break free<br>
                I want to break free<br>
                I want to break free from your lies<br>
                You're so self satisfied, I don't need you<br>
                I've got to break free<br>
                God knows</p>
            <p>God knows I want to break free<br>
                I've fallen in love<br>
                I've fallen in love for the first time<br>
                And this time I know it's for real<br>
                I've fallen in love, yeah</p>
            <p>God knows<br>
                God knows I've fallen in love<br>
                It's strange but it's true<br>
                Hey, I can't get over the way you love me like you do<br>
                But I have to be sure<br>
                When I walk out that door<br>
                Oh, how I want to be free, baby<br>
                Oh, how I want to be free<br>
                Oh, how I want to break free<br>
                But life still goes on<br>
                I can't get used to living without living without living without you<br>
                By my side<br>
                I don't want to live alone, hey<br>
                God knows</p>
            <p>Got to make it on my own<br>
                So, baby, can't you see<br>
                I've got to break free<br>
                I've got to break free<br>
                I want to break free, yeah<br>
                I want, I want, I want<br>
